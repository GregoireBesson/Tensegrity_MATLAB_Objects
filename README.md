# Tensegrity_MATLAB_Objects (MATLAB Tensegrity Dynamics Modeling and Simulation Framework) by Jeffrey Friesen

This MATLAB framework allows modeling, visualization and simulation of tensegrity systems; networks of bars and strings. The dynamics of each bar are modeled as 2 point masses, one at each end of the bar. All string and bar far forces are modeled with linear stiffness and nodes as frictionless spherical joints.

Collisions with a rigid ground are supported, but collision interactions between bar-bar bar-cable and cable-cable are currently not supported. 

This simulation provides a straightforward way to quickly assemble tensegrity structures with a simple underlying code that is easily modified to suit the users needs.
